# Exporting data from Salesforce

## From Setup

Exporting data is as simple as
1. Navigating to setup
2. Searching for "Data Export"
3. Selecting the object(s) you want to export
4. Clicking "Export Now"

You will receive a link to the exported data via email. The link will expire after 48 hours.

## From Reports

You can also export reports. This is useful for when you would like to take advantage of Salesforce's report builder to filter and sort your data.

1. Navigate to the report you would like to export. (Make sure you have saved it and that you are running the report)
2. Click on the downwards chevron next to the "Edit" button
3. Click "Export"
4. Select the format you would like to export to
