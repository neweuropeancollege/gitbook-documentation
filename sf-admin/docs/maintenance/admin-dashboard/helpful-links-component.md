### More information on the _Unimported MC Emails_ Link

- **Purpose and Functionality**
  - The "Unimported MC Emails" link on the Admin Dashboard directs to a list view specifically showing MC Subscriber Activity Records that have not been imported into Salesforce.
  - This targeted view is essential for identifying email activities from MailChimp that failed to sync with Salesforce records.

- **Action Steps for Admins**
  - Upon accessing the list via the link, the Admin can review each unimported activity.
  - For each record, the Admin should investigate the reason it was not imported. Common causes might include issues with email addresses or other syncing errors.

- **Using the 'Update on Salesforce' Function**
  - Located at the top right of the individual subscriber activity record, the 'Update on Salesforce' button is a crucial tool.
  - When clicked, this function attempts to re-sync or update the record in Salesforce.
  - If the initial import failed due to a temporary issue, using this button can often resolve the problem and complete the import process.

- **Bulk Update Functionality**
  - The Admin also has the option to select multiple records from the list view.
  - After selection, clicking on 'Update on Salesforce' in the top right allows for bulk updating.
  - This bulk action is particularly useful when dealing with numerous unimported activities, saving time and ensuring that no unimported emails are overlooked.

- **Follow-Up Actions**
  - After using the 'Update on Salesforce' feature, the Admin should verify that the action was successful.
  - This can involve checking if the record now appears as imported in Salesforce and ensuring it is correctly linked to the corresponding contact or opportunity record.

- **Importance of Regular Checks**
  - Regularly checking and updating unimported MC emails ensures that all marketing efforts are accurately reflected in Salesforce.
  - This practice is vital for maintaining data integrity and for the effectiveness of email marketing analysis and follow-up actions.
