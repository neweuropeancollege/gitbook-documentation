# Handling the Departure of a Recruiter

## Overview

This document outlines the protocol for managing Salesforce records and interactions in the event of a recruiter's departure from the organization. The focus here is on the passive approach, which involves a minimal change in record ownership, as opposed to the active approach detailed in a separate knowledge article.

## Understanding the Passive Approach

The passive approach to handling a recruiter's departure is characterized by not immediately transferring ownership of all opportunities. Instead, it involves a case-by-case transfer based on incoming inquiries. This method is advantageous for monitoring inactive opportunities and minimizing immediate workload changes.

### Key Points:

- Ownership of opportunities remains with the departing recruiter until an inquiry is received.
- This method helps in identifying inactive opportunities over time.
- Management can still view the distribution of opportunity ownership via the admin dashboard.

## Essential Steps in the Passive Approach

### Channel Record Ownership Transfer

- Identify all channel records owned by the departing recruiter.
- Transfer ownership of these records to an active recruiter or user.
- This step primarily involves the recruiter’s email address channel record and other owned channels.

### Handling Incoming Interactions

- Create a list view to filter interactions based on the ownership of the departing recruiter.
- The active sales team must manage and respond to interactions coming in from the departing recruiter’s channels.
- Refer to the knowledge article on creating list views for detailed guidance.

### Monitoring Opportunity Ownership

- Regularly review the distribution of opportunity ownership via the admin dashboard.
- This review helps in understanding the impact of the recruiter's departure on opportunity management.

## Considerations and Alternatives

- **Inactive Opportunities:** Over time, opportunities that remain under the departing recruiter's ownership and do not receive inquiries can be considered inactive.
- **Active Approach Alternative:** If desired, bulk change in opportunity ownership can be performed as detailed in a separate article. This approach may be suitable if the passive approach's impact on opportunity distribution is not desirable.

## Conclusion

The passive approach is a strategic method to manage the transition period following a recruiter's departure. It allows for a gradual shift of responsibilities and provides insights into the activity levels of various opportunities. However, it is important to balance this approach with regular reviews and adjustments based on the evolving needs of the recruitment department.
