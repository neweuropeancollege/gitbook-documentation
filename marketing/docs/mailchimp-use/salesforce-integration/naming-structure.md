# Naming Structure

In using the Exclusive Campaign Tracker model, we must select and adhere to a strict naming structure of the automations themselves in order to enable maintainability, flexibility, and upgradeability. This article outlines this naming structure and should be kept up-to-date as the structure evolves.

Keep in mind, altering the naming structure should be done with caution, as it may have unintended outcomes with existing campaign recipients that are already in queue.
