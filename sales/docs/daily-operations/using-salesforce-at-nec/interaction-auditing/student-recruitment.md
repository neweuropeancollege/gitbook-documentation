# Student Recruitment

This guide provides a detailed overview of the process involved in selecting the `Student Recruitment` record type during the auditing of interactions.

Remember, this record type is used only when the interaction is **from a prospective applicant** and is **about their inquiry or application** to NEC.

## Changing Record Type

1. **Accessing the Dialog Box**
   - Click on the `Change Record Type` button at the top right corner of the interface to open the dialog box.

2. **Selecting the Record Type**
   - Within the dialog box, select the `Student Recruitment` record type. This is applicable when handling interactions related to inquiries or applications from prospective NEC students.

## Filling in the Fields

After selecting the `Student Recruitment` record type, you will encounter a section titled `The Student`, which includes fields such as:

- **Account**
- **Contact**
- **Opportunity**
- **Email** (mandatory)

### Email Field
- The `Email` field should be populated with the email address of the prospective student or applicant.

### Typing and Selecting Records
- For the `Account`, `Contact`, and `Opportunity` fields, you will need to type in the respective search fields to find and select the correct records.
- Each field should be accurately filled to reflect the student's details.

## Making the Correct Record a Recently Viewed Item

1. **Identifying Common Naming Challenges**
   - In cases where common names make it difficult to select the correct account (e.g., multiple accounts named "Singh Administrative Account"), an additional step is required to ensure accuracy.

2. **Exiting the Dialog Box**
   - Temporarily exit the `Change Record Type` dialog box to perform a more detailed search.

3. **Using Global Search**
   - Utilize the global search feature in Salesforce to find the correct account. This can be done by searching with unique identifiers such as the first name or email address of the student.

4. **Opening the Record**
   - Once you have located the correct account, open the record. This action is critical as it marks the account as a recently viewed item in Salesforce.

5. **Navigating Back**
   - After opening the account record, you can close the tab and navigate back to the interaction.

6. **Re-Entering the Record Type Dialog**
   - Click on `Change Record Type` again to re-access the dialog box.

7. **Efficient Record Selection**
   - When you click on the search accounts input field for the lookup, Salesforce will display recently viewed items first. The last account you opened should now appear at the top of this list, ensuring you select the correct account with confidence.

8. **Applying the Same Method to Other Fields**
   - Repeat this process for `Contact` and `Opportunity` fields if necessary. Open these records to make them recently viewed items, simplifying their selection in the dialog box.

## Finalizing the Record Type Selection
- With all necessary fields verified and correctly filled, click the `Change to Student Recruitment` button at the bottom left of the dialog box to complete the process.
