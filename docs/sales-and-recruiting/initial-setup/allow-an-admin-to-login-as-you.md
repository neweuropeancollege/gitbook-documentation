# Overview

When encountering issues that require administrative intervention, it's often necessary to grant your Salesforce administrator access to your account. This allows them to troubleshoot and resolve issues directly. Below are the steps to grant this access:

1. **Locate Your Profile Picture**: 
   - Click on your profile picture located at the top right corner of the Salesforce interface. This is usually your personal avatar or a default icon if you haven't set up a personal image.

2. **Access Settings**: 
   - From the dropdown menu that appears after clicking your profile picture, select the 'Settings' option. This will take you to your personal settings page where you can manage various aspects of your account.

3. **Navigate to Account Login Access**: 
   - Within the 'Settings' page, scroll down or look for the section labeled 'My Personal Information'. Here, you will find the option 'Grant Account Login Access'.

4. **Modify Access for Your Company's Administrator**: 
   - Find the row labeled 'Your Company's Administrator'. Change the access level from 'No Access' to '1 Year'. This duration ensures that the administrator has sufficient time to address any ongoing or future issues.

5. **Save Changes**: 
   - Click the 'Save' button to apply these changes. This action will grant the necessary access to your administrator.

By following these steps, you are enabling your Salesforce administrator to access your account for troubleshooting and issue resolution.
