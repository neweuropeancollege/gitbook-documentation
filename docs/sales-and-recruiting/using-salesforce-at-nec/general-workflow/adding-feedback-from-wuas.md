# How to Add Feedback Provided by WUAS

## Overview

There are four places from which one can record WUAS feedback. All four methods entail a near identical process. This refers to both cases; when NEC requests feedback and when WUAS provides feedback.

## The Entry Points:
ðŸ“„ Directly from an open applicant opportunity's record page, indicating the opportunity for which feedback is being recorded.

ðŸ‘¤ Directly from a WUAS employee's contact record page, indicating the WUAS contact providing the feedback.

ðŸ“‹ From the opportunity list view, indicating multiple open applicant opportunities for which feedback is being recorded.

ðŸ”§ From the utility bar.

### Once the feedback recorder app opens, there are three pages (steps) to go through:

## first step

`Count` Indicate how many feedback entries you would like to record. _This option is not provided when you utilize the opportunity list view entry point._

`Type` Indicate whether you are recording NEC request for feedback (Outbound Correspondence) or WUAS has provided feedback (Inbound Correspondence).

`Time` Indicate the date and time when this feedback took place. This is important for when NEC needs to check WUAS' response times.

`Who` Indicate the WUAS representative providing the feedback. This option goes away when outbound is selected.

## second step

For every feedback you are recording, the app will ask you for:
- `Opportunity`
- `Subject Area`
- `Decision`
- `Additional Comments`
  - The WUAS Representative selected earlier goes into the comments section. This is the only way to incorporate the WUAS representative in the feedback. This comment will show in the task created on the Opportunity's timeline.

## final step

- Review your work and insert the feedbacks

## Please Note:

- The recruiter who received the feedback must initiate and complete the process, otherwise data will be incorrect.
