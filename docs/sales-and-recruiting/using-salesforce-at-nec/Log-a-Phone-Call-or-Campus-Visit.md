## Introduction

If you receive a call or a campus visit (or have any other interaction with a student in a non-digital environment), it needs to be logged.

There are two ways to log an interaction and they depend on whether the individual exists in the system or not.

* Existing in the system means we have stored a contact (and possibly an opportunity) record for that individual on Salesforce.

* The process of logging an interaction whether they exist in the system or not is the same. However, from where you kick off the process is what differs.

* Not sure if they exist in the system or not? Use the global search at the top center of your page.

## If the Individual Is Already in the System
1. Find their existing Contact or Opportunity record and open it. In there, you will find the New Interaction button on the top right.
2. Click on the button (circled red below)

4. Specify the channel in which the interaction takes place
5. Specify the contact with whom you interact
6. You might see a window (like the image below) where a contact was not found. No worries, just click Auto create roles and the default contact(s) should show up.

7. Describe the interaction contents
8. Make any noteworthy notes
9. Provide the two ratings

## If the Individual Is Not in the System
1. Use the New Interaction button at the bottom of your screen. This button is always visible as long as you are in the Back Office app.
2. Click on the button (circled red below)

3. Fill in details

4. Specify the channel in which the interaction took place
5. Enter basic contact info
6. Describe the interaction contents
7. Make any noteworthy notes
8. Provide the two ratings

Finally, there are two buttons to choose from. You will almost always use the button on the right, but may use the button on the left in extraordinary cases. Here are their differences in functionality:

1. **Insert interaction record and specify additional info/files**
   - You should (and will most of the time) use this button if this interaction has provided you with any additional information for which we have a field. Examples include:
     - Country of origin
     - Recruitment interest
     - Term
     - Mobile/phone number
2. **Insert interaction record**
   - Conversely, you should use this button if there is no additional information provided through this interaction. For example, if you decide to call an opportunity and they don't pick up, you would mention in the Interaction Contents that you called and they did not pick up and then use this button rather than the other, since there was no new information.

And that's it. The interaction is now logged and you can go about your day.
